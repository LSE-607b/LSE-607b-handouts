# Statistics-607b-LSE-2024

## Speaking order ðŸ¤­

* We will meet once a week, and the speaking order will be: [Pietro, Shakeel, Xuzhi, Zetai, Di, Pouya]. 
* Every week two people will present, and we cycle through the speaking order using overleaping blocks, so the first few talks will be given by: (Pietro, Shakeel), (Shakeel, Xuzhi), (Xuzhi, Zetai), etc.
* Certain topics will take more than a week to go through. In this case the second person from the present tuple should let the second person from the next tuple know in advance. 

## Suggestions for talks ðŸ“ˆ

* All talks should be on the whiteboard.
* Start with an accessible introduction.
* Provide one or two applications to common statistical problems. 

## Suggestions for LaTeX notes ðŸ“–

* Notes should be ~5 pages long each week, and no longer than 10 pages.
* Use Pouya's lovely LaTeX template to write up your notes.
* Start with an accessible introduction to the machinery you will discuss.
* Try to provide one or two applications of the machinery to well known statistical problems. 
* If possible possible provide some relatively straightforward problems for readers to try (no no need to provide solutions).
* Make sure to reference thoroughly.
